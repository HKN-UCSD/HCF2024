# HARD Hack 2024

The Honors Career Fair (HCF) at UC San Diego is an annual, student-organized event for top honors engineering students with high GPAs and excellent academic records. This event is co-hosted by Eta Kappa Nu (HKN), Tau Beta Pi, and UCSD Scholar's Society. This exclusive career fair allows recruiters to connect with a select group of high-achieving students in an intimate setting.

# Development
To build new html elements, create files in `templates` folder
To 'compile' and build a website using these html files, run `python hcf.py`
The reason for this is so that we do not have to manually put the same header inside every file. The python script will inject these header elements for us.
